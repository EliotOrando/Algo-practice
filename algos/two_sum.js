/*
  Given an array of numbers and a target number,
  return an array containing the indicies of 2 numbers in the array that add up to the target.

  You may assume that each array will have no more than 1 solution, and you should return -1 if a solution is not found. 

  Example:

  const nums = [2, 5, 11, 15]
  twoSum(num, 7) -> [0,1]
  Rational:  nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 5 = 7,

  twoSum(nums, 9) -> -1
  Rational: No elements inside the array sum up to the target number
*/

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  
};

module.exports = {twoSum}
