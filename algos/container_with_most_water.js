/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example: 
height: [1, 3, 2, 5]
return value of 6 b/c maximum area made by the heights is a rectangle of height 3, with a width of 2. (the rectangle formed by connecting the 3 and the 5 heights) - see example graph
