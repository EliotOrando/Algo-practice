/* Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

*** Example 1 ***
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

*** Example 2 ***
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

*** Example 3Â ***
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring. */
