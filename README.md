# Algo-practice
Repo to practice leetcode style algorithms and writing tests in JavaScript.

I'll be updating this every day or so. There are 3 branches

1. Main -- This branch just has leetcode style algorithms. It is up to you to write both the tests and the solution to the problems

2. algos-tests-written -- This branch has tests already written out, you need to solve them

3. solutions -- this branch contains both tests and solutions to each problme. Use these if you ever get stuck. I'll try to comment my solutions as best as I can.
